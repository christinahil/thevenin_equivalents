# thevenin_equivalents

This project contains functions for

Computing the factorization of part of the power system representing the current sources or non-controlled sources using KLU, which also determines the Thevenin impedances for all the nodes.

Computing the Thevenin voltages using the lu factors from the factorization and the Thevenin impedance.
  

  
The code contains a demo using a small system and parallization on 2 cores.
